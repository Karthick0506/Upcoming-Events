 Photography is a medium used to tell stories – sometimes they are told in one picture, sometimes you need a whole series. Those series can be photo essays.

If you’ve never done a photo essay before, or you’re simply struggling to find your next project, this article will be of help. I’ll be showing you what a photo essay is and how to go about doing one.

You’ll also find plenty of photo essay ideas and some famous photo essay examples from recent times that will serve you as inspiration.

If you’re ready to get started, let’s jump right in. A photo essay is a series of images that share an overarching theme as well as a visual and technical coherence to tell a story. Some people refer to a photo essay as a photo series or a photo story – this often happens in photography competitions.

Photographic history is full of famous photo essays. Think about The Great Depression by Dorothea Lange, Like Brother Like Sister by Wolfgang Tillmans, Gandhi’s funeral by Henri Cartier Bresson, amongst others. Despite popular belief, the type of photo essay doesn’t depend on the type of photography that you do – in other words, journalism, documentary, fine art, or any other photographic genre is not a type of photo essay.

       <p> The photographs on the walls of a person’s home or office can communicate a lot about what is important to him. Important people and events often are captured in photos that are preserved long after the people themselves are gone, allowing later generations to experience history. Photography is a well-established medium for preserving family and cultural histories as well. The people or events that are photographed perhaps will never be the same again, so taking advantage of opportunities to take photos allows for the remembrance of things as they once were.</p>

       <p>Social media channels are full of people sharing photographs to communicate with others. In fact, some websites and social channels are built to simply allow people to share photos. As is evidenced by award-winning photos seen in the pages of magazines and websites, a photo is able to describe and to move a person to act in ways that words themselves may not. Good descriptive paragraphs take into account the five senses: smell, taste, touch, sound and sight. Though sight is often considered the first thing a writer notices, sometimes it is best in writing a descriptive paragraph to leave this detail to the end. Instead, start with something less obvious, such as smell or taste. After this the writer can describe what something feels and sounds like. Using varied descriptive words also helps a reader better understand the subject being described.</p>
